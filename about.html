		<h1>Solve this puzzle</h1>

		<p>
			50 red birds and 50 blue birds are randomly sitting on two wires which are across from each other. How can they rearrange themselves so that 
			all the blue birds are on one wire and all the red birds are on the other wire, if they can't see their own color, but can see the color of the birds around them. 
			They also can't tell another bird its color. They can come up with a strategy together.
